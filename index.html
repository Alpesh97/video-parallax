We’ve learned from them, too, to inform the way we work—early deliverables, small responsive teams, weekly sprints, real time collaboration, adding value at every stage. We respect the process to bring results.</p>

                            <p>In June 2013, Speakeasy opened its doors in a two bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C. and became home to some of the world’s greatest technology brands. At our core, we were big agency PR people with an itch to work together in a new, impactful and fun way.</p>
                            <p>Speakeasy grew to embody a different style, a different process, and has played an integral part in the proliferation of enterprise and open source technologies. Global brands, open source foundations, thought leaders, CMOs, all gravitated towards Speakeasy.</p>
                            <p>While we have grown to become a Silicon Valley staple and international brand, the agency has never strayed from our original idea to work behind the scenes bringing clients into a speakeasy kind of world -- so they get the keys to our culture, commitment and an incredible media mix.</p>
                            <p>A relentless belief in fast content, shareable stories and timely ideas to carry the day. Make securing the media results the easy part.</p>
                            <p>Over 7 years, Speakeasy has expanded from our Washington roots to become a global community of writers, brand practitioners, social media pros, media relations experts and analyst specialists who all contribute to our unique service offerings and attitude.</p>
                            <p>All are welcome to enter and find the unexpected.</p>

                            <span>Why it Mattered</span>
                            <p>Red Hat was first, and best, at delivering open-source solutions to the enterprise. More than any other company, Red Hat is the North Star for everything open source, from technology to leadership to how workplaces work.

                            <span>Answer</span>
                            <p>Red Hat’s PR program needed more than product news to remain top-of-mind for the technology and developer media that speak to the innovators in the industry. Speakeasy activated a smart newsroom approach -- using experienced technical writers to develop pitches that spoke to reporters and developer peers. The answer was to make Red Hat an even more credible source of useful and informative content on topics that mattered to Red Hat’s audience, such as containers, Kubernetes, cloud-native, and modern application development trends. </p>

                            <p>Speakeasy drew on its deep subject-matter expertise to identify the right topic for the right outlet, creating pitches and content that resonated with the media and with their audiences. Each article enhanced Red Hat’s thought leadership and enriched readers’ knowledge, ensuring a high pick-up rate.</p>
                            <span>Details</span>
                            <p>The goal was not coverage volume at any cost, but a sustained uptick in media coverage, with proactive articles every month that spoke to the right audiences, re-igniting Red Hat’s strength of voice.</p>

                            <p>Speakeasy’s targeted, knowledgeable pitches resulted in increased numbers of interviews, contributed articles, slideshows and podcasts across a wide variety of developer and technology media. More importantly, Speakeasy generated the type of articles that tech professionals and developers want to read -- vendor-agnostic, tutorial and educational -- and inserted Red Hat into the right conversations to regain its rightful position as thought leader and technology leader in all things open source</p>
